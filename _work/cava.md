Launched an initiative to redesign and scale an Elixir API powering a food ordering app and website, migrating from Heroku to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, teaching DevOps concepts to a growing engineering team and guiding software architecture evolution. Led technical engagement for a digital agency partnership to redesign a mobile app, website and API, structuring agreements, processes and tooling to deliver well-tested, well-documented code while keeping our internal engineering team actively engaged to ensure familiarity with the architecture and a smooth handoff. Worked closely with in-house recruiters to create a hiring plan, write job descriptions, screen candidates and craft a more inclusive interview process, doubling the size of the engineering team and laying the groundwork for continued growth.
