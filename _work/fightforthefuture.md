Worked with a small, close-knit team of digital activists on tech policy campaigns around net netraulity and surveillance, building and maintaining campaign sites, backend infrastructure and an embedadble widget. Collaborated with a contract developer and coalition partner engineers in preparation for and during a large day of action, monitoring critical infrastructure and rapidly triaging bugs to ensure we remained able to collect petition signatures and submit comments to Congressional representatives and the FCC.
