Worked in a fast-paced, deadline-driven small agency environment to create and maintain dynamic, CMS-powered websites for several real estate development clients. Hand-coded in compliance with current standards and best practices, testing across multiple browsers to ensure consistency and compatibility. Researched and implemented new strategies and technologies to translate artistic vision into compelling digital executions. Maintained unfamiliar legacy code, quikly discerning functionality and methodology in order to make updates, adjustments or additions.
