Worked in a large agency environment to build and maintain websites for multinational clients. Supported development on larger sites while working individully on smaller projects, using SVN and Bugzilla for version control and collaboration. Researched innovative solutions to client requests, delving into the [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) and [Symfony 2](http://symfony.com/) PHP frameworks, [Modest Maps](http://modestmaps.com/), [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), Objective-C and HTML5 offline storage. Rapidly built prototypes, including an iOS app that secured new business from Visa.
