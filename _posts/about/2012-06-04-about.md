I'm a software engineer and activist committed to social justice and interested in building systems that are resistant to surveillance and tools to facilitate collective liberation.

I believe technologists have an obligation to safeguard the privacy of users who trust us with their most sensitive data. Open source software is not a panacea against abuse, and open data and transparency shouldn't be simple end goals, but rather instruments for maintaining accountability and effecting change. Algorithms and data are not neutral, and developers need to accept responsibility for and study the real-world impact of platforms they create and data they collect. in my opinion, the biggest challenge in increasing adoption of secure technology is making existing tools more accessible and advocating for security and encryption by default.

I'm currently searching for a position that allows me to be involved in shaping strategic direction in addition to writing code. I recognize the important of building an inclusive, diverse workplace and know this is work that takes dedicated effort. I've worked in both hierarchical and horizontally organized structures, and I value leadership that facilitates open dialogue and empowers workers.
