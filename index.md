I'm a software engineer and activist interested in building healthy, sustainable communities and distributed, scalable systems.

I believe technologists have an obligation to safeguard the privacy of users who trust us with their most sensitive data, and the dignity of workers who earn their livelihoods on platforms we build. Open source code, open data and transparency should not be simple end goals, but rather instruments for maintaining accountability and effecting change. Algorithms and data are not neutral, and engineers need to accept responsibility for and study the real-world impact of platforms we create and data we collect.

I'm currently searching for a staff engineer or architect position that allows me to contribute to strategic direction in addition to writing code and mentoring other engineers. I recognize the value of building an inclusive, diverse workplace and know this is work that takes dedicated effort. I've worked in both hierarchical and horizontally organized structures, and I value leadership that facilitates open dialogue and empowers workers.
